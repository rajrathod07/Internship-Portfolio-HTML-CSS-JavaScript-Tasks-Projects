      I like to develop new web pages because it gives me more knowledge and
      information about real-world activities and new things. I also like to
      explore new technologies and innovations, which helps me spend my time in
      a more valuable way. I enjoy learning new things.

      capability and knowledge. Additionally, I have an interest in cyber
